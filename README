trivial-garbage is a simple library that provides a portable API to
finalizers, weak hash-tables and weak pointers.

It is placed in the public domain with absolutely no warranty.

The various bits of funcionality (finalizers, weak pointers, etc...)
are mutually independent. Feel free to copy whatever bits you find
useful into your own program as they are, after all, in the public
domain. :-)
